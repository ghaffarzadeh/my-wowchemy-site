abstract: Increasing the penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) in public
  transportation, which is also sped up by governments' carbon net-zero
  policies, will significantly increase the demand for electricity. Therefore,
  when we face with a large population of selfish EV users, we need a
  coordination mechanism to manage both the traffic congestion and electricity
  resource limitations. This paper introduces a novel aggregative game model
  where heterogeneous EVs simultaneously plan their parking lot as their
  destination (usually accompanied by battery charging) and the route to the
  destination. The cost function of users consists of factors such as traveling
  time, variable costs of congestion and electricity demand, and tolling which
  is imposed to satisfy coupling constraints such as roads' capacity and
  stations' power capacity. Since the users are selfish and do not reveal their
  objectives and personal constraints, we propose a privacy preserving
  decentralized algorithm with a traffic coordinator and multiple stations'
  coordinators for generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) seeking of the game model.
  Only aggregate information such as traffic on the road and stations' energy
  demand are available to the traffic coordinator and charging stations'
  coordinators, respectively. We show that the proposed aggregative game admits
  a unique variational generalized Nash equilibrium (v-GNE). Then, using the
  theory of variational inequality (VI), we show that the proposed decentralized
  algorithm converges to the unique v-GNE of the game. Finally, we carry out
  comprehensive simulation studies on a simulated Savannah city model to compare
  and evaluate the proposed method.

summary: A joint routing and destination planning model for heterogeneous users
  is developed using aggregative games. Critical infrastructure constraints are
  guaranteed not to be violated in the proposed framework when incentive pricing
  is employed and coupling constraints are considered among usersâ€™ decisions. In
  particular, we discuss the charging station selection problem of electric
  vehicles, where users consider travel time and charging price when choosing
  where to charge their vehicle. In addition, charging stations and
  transportation networks provide common aggregate information and prices.
  Consequently, the aggregative game framework provided a scalable decentralized
  solution to the Nash equilibrium seeking problem while providing privacy for
  users.
